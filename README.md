# SeaPort

SeaPort is a fast port scan result analyzer that consumes scan results from Rapid7 and filters those IPs specific to a country of your choosing.

This project was done in C# as Python was too slow due to some dataset being too large.

### Dependencies
* #### MaxMind GeoIP2

### Where to fetch your Scan Results?
Scan results can be fetched from Rapid7's SONAR project [here](https://opendata.rapid7.com/).
